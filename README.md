## Project Description
Ask any young child what they want to do when they grow up and you'll find that, in some cases, the answer will be to play video games or to become a content creator.  In today's day and age it's not uncommon for young (or even older) individuals to persue a career in the video game industry.  Playing video games professionally is one way to make a living, but unfortunately, just like any other sport/activity, you'll need to be one of the best players in the world to make it to the professional gaming scene called Esports. Esports , short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games.  Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayaer video game competititons, particularly between professional players, indivudaully or as a team.
